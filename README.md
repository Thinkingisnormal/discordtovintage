# Vintage Story Discord Bot
## Description

This is a Discord bot designed to interact with a Vintage Story game server. The bot provides functionality to start and stop the game server, as well as monitor server messages for specific events. I made this so my friends can turn on my server when away from computer, also was a fun project. This is my first project that isnt a game or anything, so expect problems. Feel free to pick apart anything and even take it for your own

## Installation
Download the repository, link it up with your discord bot using a .env file filling the 'DISCORD_TOKEN' 'CLIENT_ID' env variables. run it with 'node . ' and I think it should work hopefully.
